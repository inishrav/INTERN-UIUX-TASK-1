# INTERN-UIUX-TASK-1
 A user-friendly login page with options for users to enter their email and password, along with a feature to recover forgotten passwords.
The screen includes an illustrative graphic to make the login process more engaging and intuitive.
The design is focused on providing a smooth, intuitive user experience, making it easy for users to get started with the app. 
This task allowed me to refine my skills in creating efficient and aesthetically pleasing UI/UX designs, with a strong emphasis on user needs and accessibility.
